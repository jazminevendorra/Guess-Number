# Guess-Number
Number guessing game where a player will get up to seven chances to guess a mystery number in the range of 1 trough 100.
At the beginning of the game, the program will generate a random number in the range 1 through 100. 
It will then prompt the player to guess the number. 
If the user’s guess is:
\n Higher than the random number => the program will display “Too High …”.
\n Lower than the random number => the program will display “Too Low … ”.
\n The same as the random number => the program will congratulate the player.
